# KALPA
Knowledge-Aware Language for Precise Algorithms


🧠 Think of KALPA as:
A "human-first, logic-explicit" programming language.
Like Assembly for the mind, not for the machine.

## 🆚 How is KALPA Different from Assembly?

At first glance, KALPA might feel a bit like Assembly — both are **explicit** and **step-by-step**. But that’s where the similarity ends.

KALPA is **not low-level machine code** — it’s a high-level, human-readable language inspired by **Sanskrit’s grammar** and **structured English**.

You don’t need to memorize symbols or hidden behaviors.  
Just write what you mean, and KALPA runs it exactly as described.
